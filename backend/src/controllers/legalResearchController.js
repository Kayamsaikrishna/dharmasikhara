            Court: Bombay High Court
            Date: October 15, 2023
            Bench: Justice A.K. Patnaik, Justice R.S. Deshpande
            
            JUDGMENT:
            
            This appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 15th March, 2023 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Mumbai, in Sessions Case No. 123 of 2022, whereby the appellant has been convicted for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs. 1,00,000/-.
            
            FACTS:
            
            The prosecution case is that on 10th January, 2022, the deceased 'X' was found murdered in his house at Andheri, Mumbai. The appellant and the deceased were business partners and there were disputes regarding their business transactions. The prosecution alleged that the appellant had murdered the deceased due to these business disputes.
            
            EVIDENCE:
            
            The prosecution examined several witnesses including the investigating officer, forensic experts, and eyewitnesses. The post-mortem report indicated that the deceased had sustained multiple injuries caused by a sharp weapon. Digital evidence from the CCTV cameras installed in the building was also presented.
            
            JUDGMENT:
            
            After carefully examining the evidence on record, we find that the prosecution has successfully established the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstantial evidence, coupled with the digital evidence, clearly points to the involvement of the appellant in the commission of the offence.
            
            The digital evidence in the form of CCTV footage showing the appellant entering the deceased's house around the time of the incident, and his subsequent hurried exit, is highly incriminating. The forensic evidence also supports the prosecution's case.
            
            We find no merit in the appeal and accordingly dismiss the same. The conviction and sentence imposed by the learned trial Court is hereby confirmed.`,
            summary: 'This case dealt with similar circumstances involving evidence analysis and bail applications. The court examined the admissibility of digital evidence and the procedures for conducting client interviews in custody. The Bombay High Court upheld the conviction based on circumstantial and digital evidence.',

            Civil Appeal No. 12345 of 2023

            Bench: Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, Justice A.S. Bopanna
            
            JUDGMENT:
            
            This appeal by special leave arises out of the judgment and order dated 20th June, 2023 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 456 of 2022.
            
            The appellant was convicted by the learned Additional Sessions Judge for offences under Sections 302, 392 and 397 IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine.
            
            The main issue before this Court is whether the learned High Court was justified in upholding the conviction of the appellant primarily based on digital evidence without proper authentication.
            
            After hearing learned counsel for the parties and examining the evidence on record, we are of the view that the digital evidence in question was not properly authenticated as required under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act.
            
            The provisions of Section 65B are mandatory and cannot be bypassed merely because the opposite party does not object to the admissibility of the electronic evidence.
            
            In view of the above, we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned judgment. The conviction of the appellant is hereby quashed and he is directed to be released from custody forthwith, if not required in any other case.
            
            Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.`,

            Criminal Appeal No. 789 of 2023
            
            Judgment delivered on: August 30, 2023
            
            Bench: Justice S.K. Sharma, Justice P.K. Jain
            
            JUDGMENT:
            
            This criminal appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 15th April, 2023 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Jaipur, whereby the appellant has been convicted for the offence punishable under Section 498A IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years.
            
            The appellant is the husband of the complainant. The prosecution case is that the appellant and his family members subjected the complainant to mental and physical cruelty for dowry.
            
            The main contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellant is that the evidence led by the prosecution is insufficient to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubt and that the trial court has not considered the defence evidence properly.
            
            After examining the evidence on record and the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties, we find merit in the appeal.
            
            The prosecution witnesses have given contradictory statements regarding the nature and extent of cruelty alleged. The medical evidence also does not support the allegations of physical cruelty.
            
            While we do not condone any form of cruelty against women, in the present case, we find that the prosecution has failed to establish the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
            
            In view of the above, we allow the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellant. The appellant is directed to be released from custody forthwith, if not required in any other case.`,
