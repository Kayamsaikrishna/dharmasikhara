### Step 4: Interacting with the System

#### Text-Based Interaction

2. Press Enter or click the Send button to submit your response
3. The AI will respond as the judge or opposing counsel

#### Voice-Based Interaction
1. Click the Microphone button to begin speaking
2. Speak your legal arguments naturally
3. The system will visualize your voice input in real-time
4. Release the button when finished
5. The system will process your speech and respond accordingly

#### Document Review

2. Select any document to view its contents
3. Use the navigation controls to browse through pages
4. Add bookmarks to important sections

#### Evidence Analysis
1. Click the "Evidence" tab
2. Browse through the digital evidence
3. Select any piece of evidence to view detailed analysis
4. Generate paperwork templates as needed

### Step 5: Sample Legal Arguments

#### Opening Statement Example
When prompted for your opening statement, you might say:
```
Your Honor, I represent Mr. Rajesh Kumar, who stands accused of theft based on circumstantial evidence that, upon closer examination, reveals significant inconsistencies. The prosecution's case relies heavily on a misinterpretation of CCTV footage and fails to investigate other plausible explanations for the missing laptop. We will demonstrate that the digital inventory logs were falsified before the inventory even began, suggesting internal fraud rather than theft by my client. Mr. Kumar has no criminal history, strong community ties, and has voluntarily surrendered his passport. The evidence points not to guilt, but to a frame-up that this court must carefully examine.
```

#### Bail Argument Example
For the bail application, you might present:
```
Your Honor, we respectfully submit that bail should be granted to Mr. Rajesh Kumar under Section 437 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The ingredients for bail are clearly met: (1) my client has no prior criminal record, (2) he has strong family ties in Bangalore with his wife, child, and father who is ready to stand as surety, (3) he has voluntarily surrendered his passport demonstrating no intention to flee, (4) the offense, while serious, does not indicate he poses a threat to society, and (5) the investigation can proceed without his continued detention. The prosecution's evidence is circumstantial and disputed, making this a bailable case in the interests of justice. Denying bail would be punitive without justification and would separate a father from his young child without legal necessity.
```

### Step 6: Using Spiritual References
The system includes references to the Bhagavad Gita which can be used in your arguments:
1. Navigate to the "Documents & Books" tab
2. Open the "Bhagavad Gita" virtual book
3. Reference relevant quotes such as:
   - "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but not to the fruits of action"
   - "Speak the truth, fulfill your duty"
4. These can be used to reinforce ethical arguments about your client's character

### Step 7: Evidence Presentation
1. In the "Evidence" tab, review the digital inventory logs
2. Point out the timestamp discrepancy showing the laptop was marked "dispatched to Service Center" before the inventory began
3. Highlight that there is no service ticket or record at the service center
4. Use this to argue that someone falsified records to frame your client

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Modal Argumentation
- Combine text, voice, and document references in your arguments
- Use the Bhagavad Gita references to add philosophical weight to ethical arguments
- Reference specific evidence by name and exhibit number

### Real-time Objection Handling
- When the AI presents counter-arguments, respond with legal precedents
- Use the document viewer to quickly reference relevant case law
- Practice proper courtroom etiquette when addressing the judge

### Paperwork Generation
- Use the evidence analysis to generate legal memoranda
- Create paperwork templates for filing motions
- Document your arguments for future reference

## Best Practices for Lawyers

### Preparation
1. Review all case documents before entering the simulation
2. Identify key evidence inconsistencies
3. Prepare legal precedents and arguments
4. Familiarize yourself with the Bhagavad Gita references

### During Simulation
1. Speak clearly and professionally when using voice input
2. Reference evidence by specific exhibit numbers
3. Address the court respectfully as "Your Honor"
4. Use proper legal terminology
5. Make eye contact with the virtual judge when presenting

### Argument Structure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions and ensure your microphone is not being used by another application
2. **Documents not loading**: Refresh the page and ensure the backend server is running
3. **AI responses delayed**: The system may be processing complex legal arguments; be patient

### Technical Requirements
- Ensure both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 5000) servers are running
- Use a modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- Allow microphone access when prompted
