# DharmaSikhara AI Integration Test

## System Components

1. **Frontend**: React application (port 3000)
2. **AI Backend**: Node.js service (port 5000)
3. **Python AI Model**: InCaseLawBERT model integration

## How to Test the Integration

### 1. Start the AI Backend Service

```bash
cd d:\law\backend
npm start
```

Verify the backend is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "AI Backend is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T10:19:21.406Z"
}
```

### 2. Start the Frontend Application

```bash
cd d:\law\frontend
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

### 3. Test the Legal Document Analysis Feature

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click on "Legal Analysis" in the navigation bar
3. Paste a legal document in the text area
4. Click "Analyze Document"
5. View the AI analysis results including:
   - Document overview (length, token count, type)
   - Key legal terms identified
   - Document summary

### 4. Expected Results

The system should successfully:
- Send the document from the frontend to the backend
- Process the document using the Python AI model
- Return analysis results to the frontend
- Display the results in a user-friendly interface

## Troubleshooting

### If the analysis fails:

1. Check that the backend service is running on port 5000
2. Verify that the Python dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers numpy
   ```
3. Ensure the InCaseLawBERT model is available at:
   `C:\Users\ASUS\.cache\huggingface\hub\models--law-ai--InCaseLawBERT`

### If the frontend doesn't connect to the backend:

1. Check that both services are running
2. Verify there are no firewall restrictions between ports 3000 and 5000
3. Check the browser console for CORS errors

## Features Implemented

- [x] Non-intrusive integration with existing frontend
- [x] Separate backend service for AI functionality
- [x] REST API endpoints for document analysis
- [x] React component for legal document analysis
- [x] Navigation integration in the main menu
- [x] Feature promotion in the homepage features section
- [x] Real-time feedback during analysis
- [x] Error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps

1. Test with various legal document types
2. Enhance the AI model with more sophisticated analysis
3. Add document upload functionality (currently text paste only)
4. Implement user authentication for saved analyses
5. Add history of previous analyses
