# Scenario Display Setup

## Overview
This document describes the scenario display structure implemented for the DharmaSikhara legal practice simulator using the actual content from your scenario PDF files. The setup follows the project's UI design patterns and integrates properly with the existing scenario navigation system, while displaying a "Coming Soon" message as per the project's display policy for initial hosting phases.

## Components Created

### 1. ScenarioDetail Component
- **File**: [frontend/src/components/ScenarioDetail.tsx](file:///d:/law/frontend/src/components/ScenarioDetail.tsx)
- **Purpose**: Displays detailed information about a specific scenario using content from your PDF files, presented as a legal mystery to solve
- **Features**:
  - Hero section with gradient background and key metrics
  - Scenario title and subtitle from your PDF content
  - Mysterious case overview that doesn't reveal the outcome
  - Investigation focus areas and legal issues to address
  - Learning objectives section with numbered cards
  - Skill focus areas from your scenario.pdf
  - Parties involved in the scenario with detailed profiles
  - Difficulty level with color coding and emoji indicators
  - Practice area and estimated time with visual cards
  - Tags for categorization based on your content
  - Assessment criteria from your scenario.pdf
  - Creator information section
  - "Coming Soon" message with disabled action buttons in an attractive card
  - Interactive experience section promoting the virtual simulation

### 2. Updated ScenarioBrowser Component
- **File**: [frontend/src/components/ScenarioBrowser.tsx](file:///d:/law/frontend/ScenarioBrowser.tsx)
- **Purpose**: Lists available scenarios with search and filter capabilities using your actual scenario data, presented as legal mysteries
- **Features**:
  - Attractive hero section with gradient background and call-to-action buttons
  - Enhanced search functionality with improved placeholder text
  - Category and difficulty filters with better styling
  - Featured scenario banner highlighting the main mystery
  - Grid display of scenarios with key information in attractive cards
  - Visual difficulty indicators with emojis
  - Tags for categorization with rounded badges
  - Links to detailed scenario pages with hover effects
  - "Coming Soon" message in an attractive gradient card with notification button

### 3. Updated Routing
- **File**: [frontend/src/App.tsx](file:///d:/law/frontend/src/App.tsx)
- **Purpose**: Adds route for scenario detail pages
- **Route**: `/scenarios/:id` mapped to ScenarioDetail component

## Scenario Data Structure

The scenario display uses the following data structure based on your PDF content:

```typescript
interface Scenario {
  _id: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  description: string;
  caseOverview: string;
  practiceArea: string;
  difficulty: 'Beginner' | 'Intermediate' | 'Advanced' | 'Expert';
  estimatedTime: number;
  rating: number;
  reviewCount: number;
  price: number;
  tags: string[];
  status: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  creator: {
    username: string;
    name: string;
  };
  learningObjectives: string[];
  courtType: string;
  parties: {
    role: string;
    name: string;
    description: string;
  }[];
  skillFocus: string[];
  duration: string;
  assessmentCriteria: string[];
  investigationPoints: string[];
  legalIssues: string[];
}
```

## Actual Scenario Data

For the first scenario "The Inventory That Changed Everything", the implementation uses content from both of your PDF files but presents it as a mystery:

### From "The Inventory That Changed Everything.pdf" and "scenario.pdf":
- Case presented as a mystery to solve rather than revealing the outcome
- Character details (Rajesh Kumar, Mr. Suresh, Ravi, etc.) as potential suspects
- Investigation points and legal issues to address
- Learning objectives focused on investigation and legal reasoning
- Skill focus areas that emphasize critical thinking and evidence analysis

## Key Changes to Maintain Mystery
1. **Case Overview**: Presents the situation as an unfolding mystery rather than revealing what happened
2. **Investigation Focus**: Highlights areas for users to explore rather than providing conclusions
3. **Parties Presentation**: Describes characters as potential suspects/witnesses without revealing their roles
4. **Learning Objectives**: Emphasizes investigation and critical thinking skills
5. **Interactive Experience**: Promotes the virtual simulation as a way to uncover the truth

## Integration with Existing System

The scenario display structure integrates with the existing DharmaSikhara system by:

1. Following the same UI design patterns and components
2. Using the existing navigation system
3. Maintaining consistency with the project's color scheme and branding
4. Implementing the "Coming Soon" policy for initial hosting phases
5. Using the same authentication context where applicable

## Access Points

Users can access scenarios through:

1. Main navigation to the Scenarios page (`/scenarios`)
2. Clicking on any scenario card to view details (`/scenarios/:id`)
3. Search and filter functionality on the Scenarios page

## Next Steps

When you're ready to implement the internal functionality for scenarios, the following components will need to be updated:

1. ScenarioDetail component to enable the "Start Legal Simulation" button
2. Backend API endpoints to provide real scenario data
3. Scenario execution logic and UI components
4. Progress tracking and completion features
5. Virtual courtroom simulation with conversational interface
6. Evidence analysis tools and investigation features

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that follows all project specifications and uses your actual scenario content presented as a mystery, ready for the internal functionality to be added later.
