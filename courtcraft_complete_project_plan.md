## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.1 Problem Statement

**The Crisis in Legal Education:**
- Law students graduate with theoretical knowledge but zero practical experience
- 45% of junior associates feel unprepared for actual legal work
- Traditional apprenticeship model is failing due to time constraints and costs
- No safe environment to practice and fail before handling real cases
- Firms spend ₹5-15 lakhs per associate on training in first 2 years
- High attrition rates (30-40%) due to poor skill-reality match

**Current Gaps:**
- Moot courts: Limited frequency, highly scripted, no real consequences
- Internships: Menial tasks, limited hands-on experience
- Online courses: Passive video watching, no active practice
- On-the-job learning: Expensive mistakes, client dissatisfaction, career damage

### 1.2 Our Solution

**CourtCraft** is an immersive, AI-powered legal practice simulator that allows law students and junior lawyers to:
- Practice unlimited realistic legal scenarios
- Make mistakes in a safe environment
- Receive instant AI-powered feedback
- Build practical skills through consequence-based learning
- Create portfolios of their best performances
- Compete with peers in multiplayer mode

**Think:** Flight simulator for pilots = CourtCraft for lawyers
