### Evidence Discrepancy

- No service center record exists
- Suggests internal fraud, not theft

### Character Evidence
- 4 years with company without incident

- Voluntary appearance and passport surrender
- No motive for theft

## Common Responses to Expect

### From the Judge
- "Counsel, please proceed with your opening statement"
- "How do you respond to the prosecution's evidence?"
- "What grounds do you present for bail?"

### From the Prosecutor
- "Counsel, the CCTV clearly shows your client..."
- "The evidence points to clear theft"
- "Bail would undermine the investigation"

## Quick Responses You Can Use

### To CCTV Objections
"Your Honor, with respect, the footage shows my client retrieving his mobile charger, not stealing a laptop. The camera angle and low resolution make the hard plastic case appear rectangular and substantial."

### For the Digital Log Discrepancy
"The prosecution ignores that the laptop was marked 'dispatched to Service Center' at 9:47 a.m., 13 minutes before the inventory began. There is no service ticket or record."

### For Character Evidence
"My client has worked honestly for four years, has strong family ties, and voluntarily surrendered his passport. He poses no flight risk."
