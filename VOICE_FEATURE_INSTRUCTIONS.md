# Voice Feature Instructions for Legal Simulation

## Overview
The CourtCraft legal simulation includes advanced voice recognition capabilities that allow you to practice courtroom advocacy using natural speech. This guide will help you make the most of these features.

## Voice Feature Setup

### Browser Permissions
1. When you first access the courtroom simulation, your browser will prompt for microphone access
2. Click "Allow" to enable voice features
3. If you accidentally deny access, you can change this in your browser settings:
   - Chrome: Settings > Privacy and security > Site Settings > Microphone
   - Firefox: Preferences > Privacy & Security > Permissions > Microphone
   - Edge: Settings > Cookies and site permissions > Manage permissions > Microphone

### Testing Your Microphone
1. Look for the microphone button at the bottom of the chat interface
2. Click it to begin recording
3. You should see a visual indicator showing your voice level
4. Speak normally and observe the visualization
5. Release the button to stop recording

## Using Voice Features Effectively

### Speaking Tips
1. **Speak clearly and at a moderate pace**
   - The system works best with clear, deliberate speech
   - Avoid speaking too quickly or too softly
   - Enunciate legal terms clearly

2. **Use natural courtroom language**
   - "Your Honor, I object to the prosecution's interpretation"
   - "Counsel for the state has not addressed the key evidence"
   - "We respectfully submit that the evidence points to..."
   - "The Bhagavad Gita teaches us about duty and truth"

3. **Structure your arguments clearly**
   - Begin with "Your Honor" to address the judge
   - Present your main point clearly
   - Support with evidence references
   - Conclude with a specific request

### Voice Visualization
During recording, you'll see:
- A pulsing red indicator showing recording is active
- A visual waveform showing your voice level
- A timer showing recording duration
- The message "Speak now. Your words are being transcribed in real-time."

### Processing Time
After releasing the microphone button:
- The system will show "Processing your statement..."
- This typically takes 1-2 seconds
- Your spoken words will appear in the text input area
- The system will then send your message and await a response

## Voice Command Examples

### Opening Statements
- "Your Honor, I represent Mr. Rajesh Kumar who stands accused of theft"
- "The prosecution's case is built on a misinterpretation of evidence"
- "We will demonstrate that the digital logs were falsified"

### Legal Arguments
- "Under Section 437 of the Criminal Procedure Code, bail should be granted"
- "My client poses no flight risk and has strong community ties"
- "The evidence points not to guilt but to a frame-up"

### Evidence Presentation
- "I direct the court's attention to Exhibit A, the digital inventory logs"
- "These show the laptop was dispatched before the inventory began"
- "There is no service ticket or record at the service center"

### Spiritual References
- "As the Bhagavad Gita teaches, we must speak the truth"
- "My client has performed his duty without attachment to results"
- "The prosecution asks us to be stricken by appearances rather than evidence"

### Responses to Objections
- "Your Honor, with respect, the prosecution has not investigated..."
- "Counsel for the state ignores the timeline discrepancy"
- "The evidence when properly examined points to internal fraud"

## Troubleshooting Voice Features

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Microphone not detected**
   - Check that your microphone is properly connected
   - Ensure no other applications are using the microphone
   - Refresh the page and try again
   - Check browser permissions for microphone access

2. **Poor recognition accuracy**
   - Speak more clearly and at a moderate pace
   - Ensure you're in a quiet environment
   - Position your microphone closer to your mouth
   - Try using a headset microphone for better results

3. **Recording not starting**
   - Make sure you've granted microphone permissions
   - Check that your browser supports the MediaRecorder API
   - Try using a different browser if issues persist

4. **Processing delays**
   - Normal processing takes 1-2 seconds
   - If it takes longer, check your internet connection
   - Refresh the page if processing seems stuck

### Browser Compatibility
The voice features work best with:
- Google Chrome (recommended)
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari (limited support)

## Best Practices for Voice Advocacy

### Preparation
1. **Practice key phrases beforehand**
   - Rehearse your opening statement
   - Prepare responses to likely objections
   - Familiarize yourself with legal terminology

2. **Organize your arguments**
   - Have a clear structure in mind
   - Know which evidence you want to reference
   - Prepare transitions between points

### During Voice Input
1. **Pause before and after speaking**
   - Give the system time to start recording
   - Allow a moment before releasing the button

2. **Speak naturally but clearly**
   - Don't shout or whisper
   - Maintain your normal speaking pace
   - Emphasize important words appropriately

3. **Use proper courtroom etiquette**
   - Address the judge as "Your Honor"
   - Use formal legal language
   - Maintain a professional tone

### Reviewing Transcribed Speech
1. **Check the text before sending**
   - The system will show your transcribed speech in the input area
   - Correct any obvious errors before submitting
   - You can edit the text if needed

2. **Resend if necessary**
   - If transcription was poor, you can delete and try again
   - Or switch to typing for important arguments

## Advanced Voice Features

### Multi-Part Arguments
You can make complex arguments in multiple recordings:
1. Record your first point
2. Wait for the AI response
3. Record your second point
4. Continue building your case incrementally

### Combining Voice and Text
- Use voice for main arguments
- Use text for precise citations
- Switch between methods as needed

### Voice Level Monitoring
- The visualization helps you monitor your volume
- Speak at a consistent level for best results
- Avoid sudden volume changes

## Voice Feature Limitations

### Current Capabilities
- Real-time speech-to-text conversion
- Natural language processing for legal arguments
- Integration with the courtroom simulation environment
- Voice level visualization

### Known Limitations
- May struggle with heavy accents or background noise
- Processing delays with complex legal terminology
- No offline voice recognition (requires internet connection)
- Limited support for non-English languages

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Voice Commands
1. Say: "Your Honor, I am ready to begin"
2. Say: "I represent the defendant in this case"
3. Say: "We request bail under Section 437"

### Exercise 2: Evidence Presentation
1. Say: "I direct the court's attention to Exhibit A"
2. Say: "These digital logs show a discrepancy"
3. Say: "The laptop was dispatched before the inventory"

### Exercise 3: Complete Opening Statement
Record a 30-second opening statement using the techniques described in the legal script examples.

### Exercise 4: Response to Objection
Practice responding to a hypothetical objection from the prosecution using voice commands.

## Getting Help

If you experience persistent issues with voice features:
1. Check that your browser is up to date
2. Try using a different browser
3. Ensure you have a stable internet connection
4. Test your microphone with other applications
5. Contact technical support if problems continue

Remember that voice features are meant to enhance your legal practice experience. You can always fall back to text input if needed, and you can combine both methods in a single simulation session.
