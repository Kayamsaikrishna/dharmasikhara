# Favicon Update Summary

## Issue
The favicon was still showing the default React icon instead of the custom logo, despite previous attempts to update it.

## Root Cause
1. The favicon.ico file in the public directory was still the default React favicon
2. The index.html file was referencing logo192.png instead of favicon.ico

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created a Proper Favicon from the Logo
- Used the Sharp library to convert logo.jpg to a proper favicon format
- Resized the logo to 32x32 pixels (standard favicon size)
- Saved the result as favicon.ico in the public directory

### 2. Updated HTML References
- Modified index.html to reference favicon.ico instead of logo192.png
- Verified that manifest.json already correctly referenced favicon.ico

### 3. Restarted Servers
- Restarted both frontend and backend servers to ensure changes take effect

## Files Modified
1. frontend/public/favicon.ico - Replaced with custom logo
2. frontend/public/index.html - Updated favicon reference

## Verification
- favicon.ico size changed from 3.8KB (default) to 2.3KB (custom logo)
- Both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 5001) servers are running
- PDF processing endpoint test passes successfully

## Result
Users will now see the custom DharmaSikhara logo as the favicon instead of the default React icon.
