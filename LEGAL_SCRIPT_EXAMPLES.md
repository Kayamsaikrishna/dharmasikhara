# Legal Script Examples for CourtCraft Simulation

## Opening Statement Script

**Attorney**: Your Honor, I represent Mr. Rajesh Kumar, who stands before this court accused of theft based on what appears to be circumstantial evidence that, upon closer examination, reveals significant inconsistencies.

The prosecution's case relies heavily on a misinterpretation of CCTV footage and fails to investigate other plausible explanations for the missing laptop. We will demonstrate that the digital inventory logs were falsified before the inventory even began, suggesting internal fraud rather than theft by my client.

Mr. Kumar has no criminal history, strong community ties, and has voluntarily surrendered his passport. The evidence points not to guilt, but to a frame-up that this court must carefully examine.

In the words of the Bhagavad Gita, "Speak the truth, fulfill your duty." My client has done exactly that - he has appeared before this court without hesitation, placed his fate in the hands of justice, and awaits your judgment with the faith that truth will prevail.

We respectfully request that this court consider the totality of circumstances and grant bail to Mr. Kumar, who poses no flight risk and whose continued detention serves no purpose other than to separate a devoted father from his young child.

## Bail Application Script

**Attorney**: Your Honor, we respectfully submit that bail should be granted to Mr. Rajesh Kumar under Section 437 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The ingredients for bail are clearly met:

1. My client has no prior criminal record
2. He has strong family ties in Bangalore with his wife, child, and father who is ready to stand as surety
3. He has voluntarily surrendered his passport demonstrating no intention to flee
4. The offense, while serious, does not indicate he poses a threat to society
5. The investigation can proceed without his continued detention

The prosecution's evidence is circumstantial and disputed, making this a case where bail should be granted in the interests of justice. The digital inventory logs show that the laptop was marked "dispatched to Service Center" at 9:47 a.m. - before the inventory even began. Yet there is no service ticket, no technician signature, and no record at the service center.

This discrepancy suggests that someone falsified the digital records to create the appearance of theft. Denying bail would be punitive without justification and would separate a father from his young child without legal necessity.

In the Bhagavad Gita, it is written, "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but not to the fruits of action." My client has performed his duty as an employee faithfully for four years. He should not be punished for the fruits of someone else's actions.

We respectfully request this court to grant bail, allowing Mr. Kumar to await trial in the company of his family while the truth emerges through proper investigation.

## Response to Prosecution Objections Script

**Prosecutor**: Counsel, the CCTV footage clearly shows your client placing something substantial in his bag during the inventory.

**Attorney**: Your Honor, with respect, the prosecution's interpretation of the CCTV footage is flawed. The footage shows my client retrieving his mobile charger - a hard plastic case that, due to the camera angle and low resolution, appears rectangular and substantial like a slim laptop.

But more importantly, Your Honor, the prosecution has failed to investigate the digital inventory log discrepancy. The missing laptop was marked "dispatched to Service Center" at 9:47 a.m., 13 minutes before the inventory began. This suggests internal fraud, not theft by my client.

If the prosecution's theory were correct, why has no other employee been investigated? Why has the service center record not been produced? Why has the prosecution not explained how a laptop that was allegedly stolen at 11:03 a.m. was dispatched at 9:47 a.m.?

The evidence points not to guilt, but to a cover-up. In such circumstances, continued detention of my client serves no purpose other than to punish him for someone else's crime.

## Cross-Examination of Witness Script

**Attorney**: Mr. Mehta, you were present with my client during the inventory, were you not?

**Mehta**: Yes, I was.

**Attorney**: And you witnessed my client place something in his bag?

**Mehta**: Yes, but...

**Attorney**: But you never actually saw what he placed in his bag, did you?

**Mehta**: Well, no, not clearly.

**Attorney**: And you've worked with my client for six years?

**Mehta**: Yes.

**Attorney**: In that time, has he ever shown any inclination toward dishonesty?

**Mehta**: No, never. He's always been honest.

**Attorney**: Thank you, Mr. Mehta. No further questions, Your Honor.

## Closing Argument Script

**Attorney**: Your Honor, this case is not about whether a laptop went missing - that is not in dispute. The question before this court is who is responsible for its disappearance.

The prosecution asks you to believe that my client, a man with no criminal history, strong family ties, and a reputation for honesty, would steal a laptop in full view of a colleague and security cameras. Yet they offer no explanation for why that same laptop was marked "dispatched to Service Center" 13 minutes before the inventory began.

The prosecution's case is built on a misinterpretation of CCTV footage and ignores the digital evidence that points to internal fraud. They have not investigated other employees, have not produced service center records, and have not explained the timeline discrepancy.

In the Bhagavad Gita, it is written, "The world is stricken with desire and anger, but I will not be stricken." My client has not been stricken by desire for a ₹45,000 laptop when he earns ₹42,000 per month. He has not been stricken by anger or desperation. He has been stricken only by the injustice of being accused based on circumstantial evidence while real evidence of fraud is ignored.

We respectfully submit that the prosecution has not met its burden of proof. The evidence, when properly examined, points not to guilt but to a frame-up. We ask this court to release Mr. Kumar and direct a proper investigation into who falsified the digital inventory logs.

Truth, Your Honor, is not always visible to the naked eye. Sometimes it requires careful examination of all evidence, not just the evidence that appears to support a convenient narrative.

## Spiritual Reference Integration Script

**Attorney**: Your Honor, I would like to draw the court's attention to a principle from the Bhagavad Gita that is particularly relevant to this case. The text teaches us that "One who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is intelligent among humans."

In this case, what appears to be action - the taking of a laptop - may in fact be inaction, meaning no actual theft occurred. Conversely, what appears to be inaction - the falsification of digital records - is actually action that has caused great harm to an innocent man.

My client has demonstrated the highest principles of dharma, or righteous duty. He has appeared before this court without hesitation, placed his fate in the hands of justice, and maintained his innocence with consistency. His actions reflect the teachings of the Gita about performing one's duty without attachment to the results.

The prosecution asks this court to punish my client based on appearances rather than evidence. But as the Gita teaches, "The senses are said to be the enemies of the soul." We must not allow our senses - what we think we see on CCTV - to become the enemy of justice.

We respectfully request that this court look beyond appearances to the truth, and grant bail to a man who has demonstrated nothing but respect for the law and the principles of dharma.

## Evidence Presentation Script

**Attorney**: Your Honor, I would like to direct the court's attention to Exhibit A - the digital inventory logs. As you can see, the missing Dell Inspiron laptop was marked "dispatched to Service Center" at 9:47 a.m. on October 15, 2025.

This is 13 minutes before the inventory began at 10:00 a.m. Yet there is no service ticket, no technician signature, and no record at the service center that this laptop was ever received.

I would also like to draw attention to Exhibit B - the CCTV footage analysis. While the prosecution claims this shows my client taking a laptop, our expert analysis shows that what appears to be a laptop is actually my client's mobile charger - a hard plastic case that, due to the camera angle and low resolution, appears rectangular and substantial.

Finally, Your Honor, I would like to reference Exhibit C - the employee access records. These show that three other employees had access to the storage room that morning, yet none have been investigated by the prosecution.

The totality of evidence points not to guilt but to a cover-up. We respectfully request that this court order a proper investigation into who falsified the digital records and grant bail to my client in the meantime.
