     - C) Hearsay Exclusion
     - D) Both A and B
   - **Correct Answer**: D

## Section B: Case Analysis & Reasoning

3. **Q11**: [Multi-Select] Review this excerpt from your witness interview with the security guard: "I saw someone matching the accused's height leaving the office around 7 PM. The lights were dim, and I was about 30 feet away. I'm 70% sure it was him." Which THREE factors undermine the reliability of this identification?
   - Options:
     - A) Distance from the subject
     - B) Poor lighting conditions
     - C) Witness's expressed uncertainty (70% confidence)
     - D) The witness was off-duty at the time
     - E) Time of day (evening)
     - F) Witness has a financial interest in the case
   - **Correct Answers**: A, B, C

## Section C: Ethical Judgment

4. **Q17**: [Situational Judgment] During case preparation, your client mentions: "I know who actually took the laptop, but revealing it would get my colleague fired. Can we just blame the poor CCTV quality?" Rank these responses from MOST to LEAST appropriate:
   - Options:
     - 1) "I cannot build a defense on concealing exculpatory evidence. We must discuss ethical disclosure."
     - 2) "Let me investigate independently. If there's alibi evidence, we use it; but I cannot knowingly present false defenses."
     - 3) "Your loyalty is admirable, but withholding this information could result in your conviction. Let's explore options."
     - 4) "If you instruct me not to reveal it, I'm bound by client confidentiality. We'll focus only on CCTV weaknesses."
   - **Best Answer Order**: 2, 3, 1, 4

5. **Q18**: You discover the CCTV timestamp was altered by 15 minutes, potentially exonerating your client. However, exposing this might reveal your client accessed the security system without authorization earlier that day. Do you:
   - Options:
     - A) Disclose the timestamp issue and address the access separately
     - B) Remain silent to protect your client from additional charges
     - C) Anonymously tip the court about the timestamp discrepancy
     - D) Negotiate with prosecution to drop charges in exchange for non-disclosure
   - **Correct Answer**: A (Duty to correct false evidence outweighs collateral consequences; client must be advised of risks)

## Section D: Argument Quality Review

6. **Q22**: [Argument Deconstruction] Read this bail argument excerpt: "Your Honor, my client is innocent. The CCTV footage is unclear, and the police investigation was rushed. Many people have access to that room. Bail should be granted because the evidence is weak." Identify THREE specific weaknesses and rewrite the argument to address them.

Weaknesses:
- Asserts innocence (inappropriate at bail stage)
- Lacks specific legal standard for bail
- No affirmative facts supporting client's reliability

Improved Argument Example:
"Your Honor, under Section 437 CrPC, bail considerations focus on flight risk and evidence tampering, not guilt. My client has surrendered his passport, maintained employment for 5 years, and has dependent family members. The prosecution has failed to establish flight risk, and the evidence against him is circumstantial. Bail should be granted to allow him to prepare his defense while ensuring his presence at trial."

This demonstrates the framework's ability to evaluate legal reasoning and argument quality.
