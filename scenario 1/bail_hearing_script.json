The facts of this case are as follows: My client, Rajesh Kumar, is a 28-year-old sales executive who has been employed at Vijay Electronics for the past four years. On October 15, 2025, during a routine monthly inventory check at his workplace, a Dell Inspiron laptop valued at rupees forty-five thousand was reported missing. My client was conducting the inventory along with his colleague, one Prakash Mehta. The store manager, Mr. Arvind Desai, reviewed CCTV footage and allegedly observed my client placing an object into his personal bag. Based solely on this grainy footage, my client was arrested on October 16, 2025, and has been in custody since then. He is charged under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code."

However, according to the complainant's own case, there is no corresponding service ticket, no technician signature, and the service center has no record of receiving any laptop. This raises serious questions about what actually happened to the laptop and whether my client is being made a scapegoat."

First, regarding the offense being non-bailable - Your Honour, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the nature of the offense, while relevant, is not determinative.

Fourth, the laptop has not been recovered from his possession. Fifth, the primary evidence - the CCTV footage - is admittedly of poor quality and open to interpretation.

Once the chargesheet is filed, we will receive a copy and we can start preparing our defense properly. We will need to interview Prakash Mehta, your colleague who was with you during the inventory. We also need to get the CCTV footage analyzed by an expert to prove that the object you put in your bag was indeed a charger and not a laptop."

The magistrate has directed the police to investigate that angle. If we can prove that the laptop was never on the shelf when you were doing the inventory, your case becomes much stronger. We need to get the digital log records, find out who made that entry, and determine whether it was genuine or fabricated."

The good news is that the prosecution's case has significant weaknesses - no recovery of the laptop from you, ambiguous CCTV footage, the inventory log discrepancy, and your clean record. If we can build a strong defense with expert testimony and documentary evidence, I am confident we can secure an acquittal. But it will take time and effort."

Do you have any photos or records from that day? Any messages or emails that might be relevant? We need to gather everything we can."
